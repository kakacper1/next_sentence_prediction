1		discussing marriage , and he suddenly leaned forward and exclaimed : ' i was married once myself ' - - we were able to det ##ach him from his classification and regard him for a moment as an unique being , a soul , however insignificant , with a history of its own , once for all . it is these moments which we prize , and which alone		for any vital truth is incapable of being applied to another case : the essential is unique . perhaps that is why it is so neglected : because it is useless . what we learned about that span ##iard is incapable of being applied to any other span ##iard , or even recalled in words .
